## Quick Start

1. Deploy Contract

```bash
   npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
   ```

1. Switching to test network (RINKEBY) (Optional)

   - Please skip this step if you want to use local network
   - Change line - `const NETWORK = LOCAL_NETWORK` to `const NETWORK = TEST_NETWORK` in `hardhat.config.js`
   - Replace `YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` with your api key from alchemy in `.env` file
   - Replace `YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` with your wallet's private key from metamask wallet in `.env` file

4. Running test for contract.

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

## Running your app locally

1. Start your react frontend

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Start a hardhat node

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

3. Connect hardhat node to Metamask

   Open Metamask > Select the network dropdown from the top left > Select `Custom RPC` and enter the following details:

   - Network Name: `<Enter a name for the network>`
   - New RPC URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
   - Chain ID: `31337`

   Click save. You can use this network to connect to the local hardhat node.

4. Connect your local hardhat account to Metamask for making transactions
   - After running `npx hardhat node` you will see a list of 20 addresses logged in the terminal
   - To configure an account copy its private key from the terminal (i.e the text after `Private Key:`)
   - Open Metamask > Click the account icon on top right > Import Account > Paste the private key you just copied > click Import
   - You should now have the account connected with 10000 ETH
